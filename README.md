# Requirements
1. OpenCV with contrib
2. numpy
3. sklearn
4. matplotlib
5. Python 2.7
6. scipy

# Part 1
In part 1, we import numpy to do the numeric work on this part.


# Part 3&4

# Part 5
In part 5, we import the minimize function from the scipy.optimize to do the minimization on the vector we calculate, and the function give us the result of the ideal value of beta and gamma as shown in part5.py
